to run any of the programs use ./buildrunPROGRAM input.txt
the input.txt needs to be in the same folder as all the other files and cannot have any white space.
Every line in input.txt needs to be in the form b*******bbbb where * is either a 1 or a 0. 
I have implemented Palindromes, ones complement, incrementing, decrementing, divisibility by 3,
and zeros and ones.
